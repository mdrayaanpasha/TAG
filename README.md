# TAG - The Algorithms Group

TAG is an initiative under Cybernetics that explores algorithmic problems inspired by popular sitcoms, movies, and storytelling. Our mission is to make algorithms and problem-solving fun, engaging, and approachable for everyone.

## What We Do
- **Algorithmic Problem Design:** Frame algorithmic challenges through themes from pop culture, like Ross's infamous "break" or Joey's love for pizza from *Friends*.  
- **Presentations & Workshops:** Deliver interactive sessions and workshops to demonstrate how math and algorithms can be both practical and entertaining.  
- **Community Engagement:** Encourage students and enthusiasts to contribute ideas, solutions, and join discussions on creative problem-solving.

## Why TAG?
We believe algorithms are more than just codeâ€”they're a way of thinking. By combining storytelling with technical rigor, TAG makes learning algorithms exciting and relatable.

## Get Involved
- **Join Us:** Be part of our sessions or contribute problem ideas.
- **Collaborate:** Partner with us to bring fresh perspectives to problem-solving.
- **Follow Along:** Stay updated on our latest problems, sessions, and events.
