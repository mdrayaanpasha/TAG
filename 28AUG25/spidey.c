/**
 * @spidey.c
 * @brief A simple C program that checks if Spidey can save you based on distance constraints.
 *
 * This program simulates a scenario where Spidey must swing between buildings.
 * The buildings are represented as an array of integer positions (`arr`).
 * For Spidey to successfully swing through and save you, the gap between any
 * two consecutive buildings must not exceed 5 units.
 *
 * Logic:
 * - Iterate through the array of building positions.
 * - If the difference between any two consecutive buildings is greater than 5,
 *   Spidey cannot save you.
 * - Otherwise, Spidey can save you.
 *
 * Output:
 * - Prints "Spidey Just Saved me!!" if all consecutive gaps are â‰¤ 5.
 * - Prints "nah spidey cant do it!!" if any gap is > 5.
 *
