@brief Dynamic Programming solution to maximise sandwich consumption without eating two consecutive sandwiches.

This module defines a function `letThereBeSandwiches` that solves a variant of 
the "House Robber Problem" using dynamic programming. Given an array of integers
`sandwich`, where each value represents the tastiness (or size) of a sandwich, 
the goal is to maximise the total value eaten under the constraint that you 
cannot eat two consecutive sandwiches.

Function:
    def letThereBeSandwiches(sandwich: list[int]) -> int
        - @param sandwich: List of integers representing sandwich values.
        - @return Maximum sum of sandwich values that can be eaten without 
                  choosing two adjacent sandwiches.

Algorithm:
- Base cases:
    * days[0] = sandwich[0]
    * days[1] = max(sandwich[0], sandwich[1])
- For each i â‰¥ 2:
    * days[i] = max(days[i-1], days[i-2] + sandwich[i])
    (Choose between skipping the current sandwich or eating it along with the 
     optimal solution from two steps back.)
- Return days[n-1] as the maximum achievable value.

Example:
    Input:  sandwich = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    Output: 16
    Explanation: Optimal choice = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
